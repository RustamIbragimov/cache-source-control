Open Util.SourceControl in Studio and set the defaults: temp directory, temp global.

Go to cterm and run d ##class(Util.SourceControl).SetUp()
It will export all the classes to ..#Folder with /folder/cls/package/class.xml manner.

During your coding process it will export class from studio after every successful compilation.

..#ExpMode=1 - will generate class.cls.xml instead of class.xml - it is compatible with cache-tort-git.

DFI files (pivots and dashboards) will be exported as well.

It is very simple tool so pull requests are very welcomed.
